The server runs on a free plan, so after accessing the website, wait up to 5 minutes for the website to start working. 

Thank you for your patience.

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles TypeScript in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

The build destination is in the /dist folder.
